# TimeSeriesProject

The purpose of this project was to represent and classify the data within the file named synthetic_control.data. 
Two representation techniques were used, one was piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) and the other was 
symbolic aggregate approximation. The PAA and the original data were then classified into 6 different classes 
using Euclidean and Manhattan distance. 

To run this code, run the file named timeProject.m in MATLAB online. The report is located in 
timeSeriesReport_JaredMurray.pdf and reflection is in Reflection_JaredMurray.odf
